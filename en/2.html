<h2>Part 2: You continue your journey</h2>

<p>You're confused. But there's text here and it's probably helpful. So <strong>WHAT WILL YOU DO NEXT?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If you're a native of Windows World, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.9.1.html" target="_blank">download and open Notepad++</a>.</li>
	<li>If you're from Mac Mountain, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">download and open TextWrangler</a>.</li>
	<li>If you're from Linux Land, you probably don't need my help finding programming software...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You open up index.html and total-pages.txt with your newly found software. You also go into your folder titled "en" and open up 1.html, 2.html, and 3.html.</strong> You study them because, again, you are a good little protagonist and incredibly smart (not to mention good-looking and not too smelly).</p>

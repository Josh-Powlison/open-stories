<h2>Part 1: You begin your journey</h2>

You're on a strange webpage. You've made it through the mysterious GitHub forest with a series of sacred artifacts- all of them with intriguing names and surnames. Of particular interest to you is the one titled "index.html". You decide to double-click on it and see what happens.

As you do, a mysterious and magical wizard floats down from the sky (fortunately, he's wearing dress pants under his robe. Nobody wants to see any of <em>that</em>!). He settles on the ground in front of you. In addition to his bathrobe, he's wearing a hoodie and a great, big smile.

"Hail, [Creator_name]! I'm Josh Powlison! You look lost and confused!"

You nod your head like a good little protagonist.

"Working around here is easy! You already learned much in the GitHub forest. If you forgot any of it, open the readme and you'll be good!

"I think I'd be wasting my time repeating what you can easily learn here, hmm?" Josh flies away, obliviously assuming that you're not totally confused about everything and comtemplating the meaning of your existence.

						<p>I'm Josh and I like warm hugs! But not too warm. 'Cause that probably means you farted and are hugging me backwards. Which is <em>weird</em>.</p>

				<h3>Do you like having text after your story?</h3>
					<p>Because I do! You could do stuff like:</p>
					<p>"Check out my other story <a href="https://storieslc.com/dream-high-school/">Dream High School</a>!"</p>
					<p>"I made this awesome fan art that I'm totally going to include below:"</p>
					<p>"Bored? Here are a few of my favorite things!:"</p>
					<p>You can also remove the text inside the footer and it won't be included! Maybe you want all of your info included in the menu, I don't know! (But I recommend "About Me" and all that in the menu so they can access it at any point when reading the story)</p>
					<p>You can also just let the reader know that the story's over, by doing something like:</p>
					<hr>
					<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>THANKS FOR READING!</strong></p>
					<p style="text-align:center;">This story updates Mondays, Thursdays, and Valentine's Days! Come back later for more awesome!</p>
